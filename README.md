# JSON-RPC Prolog Server

 A Python-based JSON-RPC server for Prolog. The solver-handler provides a SLD-resolution tree step by step (This is just an example of what can be achieved with this)
 It can handle any type of Prolog expressions (unlike the basic pyswip) through the process_conjunctions function which is a 
 tree-walker for nested Prolog Terms.

@TODO: Add some documentation.
